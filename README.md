* One Man Standing
* One Try Only
* Only One Arrow/Weapon

*(see Google Doc for more)*

## Final Idea

### Morse Control

Platformer á la Celeste, Super Meat Boy etc.
Player controls character via "Morse Movement"! (i.e. press-release -> short,
press-hold-release -> long)
Movements have designated morse code (e.g. short -> jump)
Levels have moving platforms, traps and require slight timing skills
Each level is one screen, no scrolling elements

### Movement Orders

* Jump
* Walk
* Run
* Turn Around
* (Stop)
* Dash
* Crouch?

### Additional Gimmicks
* Cheatsheet PDF
* UI showing controls?
* Morse Control for menus

### Artstyle / Setting
* 2D
* Pixelart
* Mars/Curiosity setting
    - Player sits in NASA HQ, controls Curiosity drone via Morse signals
    - Low gravity settings, slow movement, long frame animations
    - Curiosity's antenna blinks when receiving signals
    - When player beats last level, Curiosity dies ("It's getting dark here...")
    - Flying rocks for platforms, space garbage for obstacles
    - Screen may be designed like the view from an old observation cam
    - Obstacles:
        + Space Garbage
        + Meteoroids
        + Mars Storm/Wind/Gust
        + Crater
* Sounddesign
    - Damped sounds from Curiosity's mic?
    - SciFi-like quiet background noise (á la StarTrek theremin)
